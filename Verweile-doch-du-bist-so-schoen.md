*All That is Solid Melts Into Air, Marshall Berman*

It appears that the very process of development, even as it transforms a wasteland into a thriving physical and social space, recreates the wasteland inside the developer himself. This is how the tragedy of development works. 

The Faustian restlessness of man in history shows that men are not satisfied by the satisfaction of their conscious desires. Norman O. Brown hoped that psychoanalytic thought, radically interpreted, might offer a way out of the nightmare of endless 'progress', and endless Faustian discontent, a way out of the human neurosis, a way out of history...so that man may be ready to live rather than to make history. Then, the restless career of Faustian men would come to an end, because he would be satisfied and could say, Verweile doch, du bist so schoen. (Stay a while, you are so beautiful).
