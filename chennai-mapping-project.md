As a Research Assistant to Professor Bhavani Raman, I helped design an open site that combines data visualization, GIS, and immersive storytelling to provide data-driven tools for activists, environmental scientists, and fisherfolk at the Story of Ennore collective in Chennai, India. Using ArcMap and QGIS, I have georeferenced 16 historical map sheets from the British Library archives. These will be overlaid with maps from the 2015 South Indian Floods and present-day to convey the dramatic loss of waterbodies in the region: from 12.6 sq. km in 1893 to 3.2 sq. km. in 2017. At stake is the desire to make the state accountable for its land grab, which depends on the historical fidelity of this mapping project; even minute distortions between historical projections and todayâ€™s web-based standard weaken a legal case.
