## About

I am pursuing my M.A. in English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University and previously completed my Hons. B.A. in Human Geography at the University of Toronto. I completed my Honours thesis under the supervision of Dr. Deborah Cowen, which sought to grasp the ambivalence of a death through Sadiya Hartmanâ€™s method of critical fabulation. Taking that the urban social is a hyphenation of the cultural and the technological, I narrated the social life of the opioid crisis through its infrastructure to implicate an entire web of punishment beyond the drug user.

I am currently exploring comparative work between literature, social theory, film and the urban; at the same time, I am invested in the study of spaces, cities and architecture. 

My M.A. essay will compare...


## Recent Writings

I published [The Sweetening of Public Infrastructures, or Tangerine](http://societyandspace.org/2018/11/27/investigating-infrastructures-a-forum/) in the online site companion to the peer-review journal, *Environment & Planning D: Society and Space*. I map a poetics of infrastructure, forwarded by Lauren Berlant, by tracing the geographies of desire, intimacy, and labour in West Hollywood, Los Angeles based on the trajectories of two Black, trans, sex workers in the film Tangerine to reveal how infrastructures are agents of punishment, but also queered and refashioned into spaces of commoning and fugitivity. Accepting that feelings of optimism are politically determined and cathected to a future good life that fails to ever materialise, I offer that Tangerine is a gesture toward the possibility of repairing infrastructures and extending lifeworlds from within brokenness.

I've also published two papers in student journals at U of Toronto: [Ghosts in the Canon: Logistics in Geographical Thought](https://geography.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Landmarks-2019-Journal-compressed.pdf) in *Landmarks*, and [LINK].

I co-edited a 60-page magazine, *Montreal: An Anti Guide [LINK NEEDED]*, combining academic research and fieldwork with student papers, artwork, poetry, and photo essays on race, gentrification, sexuality, and contested space in Montreal, Canada. This was the culmination of 5 days of fieldwork done in the summer of 2017.

## Other Projects

[Chennai Mapping Project](./chennai-mapping-project.md): I used ArcMap and QGIS to georeference 16 historical map sheets from the British Library archives. These will be overlaid with maps from the 2015 South Indian Floods and present-day to convey the dramatic loss of waterbodies in the region: from 12.6 sq. km in 1893 to 3.2 sq. km. in 2017. At stake is the desire to make the state accountable for its land grab. 

[Landmarks: Volume IV](https://geography.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Landmarks-2019-Journal-compressed.pdf): As Editor-in-Chief, it was a privilege and a delight to review all submissions. Student interventions were drawn from all corners of geography, with scales, sites, and subjects ranging from the empire to the nation (Iran) to the city (Vancouver); from eco-homes, to milk, to a cut flower.
